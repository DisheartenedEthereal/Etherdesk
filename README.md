# Dotfiles, yay!

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-dotfiles-yellowgreener)

This is my colletion of dotfiles created and optimized for my programming work and red team activites, although i might not own all the resources, the forked data is always refreneced
## I have :
- AwesomeWM
- Nvim
- Gonevim
- Tmux (TODO)

> and some more coming

## Aiming to be

- Basic, minimal
- FAST! (runs on about 350MB of ram idle)
- Practical
- All that can be configured, shall be rice-ed

Although theres an install script available, i strongly advise you to read the python file and edit it to suit your system.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.
