# Dotfiles, yay!

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-dotfiles-yellowgreener)

This is my colletion of dotfiles created and optimized for my programming work and red team activites, although i might not own all the resources, the forked data is always refreneced
## I am currently using :

| Forked/Used | SOURCE |
| ------ | ------ |
| Fish shell | [fish-shell/fish-shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) |
|Startpage|[Arturro43/Vento](https://github.com/Arturro43/Vento)|
|Tmux|[tmux/tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)|
|Bar|[polybar/polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)|
|Polybar Config|[adi1090x/polybar-themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes)|
| ~~AwesomeConfig~~ | [WillPower3309/awesome-dotfiles](https://github.com/WillPower3309/awesome-dotfiles) |

> and some more coming

## Aiming to be

- Basic, minimal, usable
- FAST! (runs on about 350MB of ram idle)
- Practical
- All that can be configured, shall be rice-ed

~~Although theres an install script available, i strongly advise you to read the python file and edit it to suit your system.~~
> There currently is no working install script available.


## Installation
The install process is normal, but you may need to change a couple of lines to your preference:
> bspwm/bspwmrc:24 path to wallpaper
> shxkd/shxkdrc:7 path to alacritty config and executable
> shxkd/shxkdrc:9 path to alacritty config and executable
> tmux/.tmux.local.conf:379 if you want tmux status bar enabled (it gets enabled by default when you open vim for the first time in tmux)

Hopefully thats it.
