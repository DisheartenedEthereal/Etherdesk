# Ethereal's Desk
This repository contains all my dot-files alongside the tools i use to manage them, this setup is quite complicated and somewhat bloated, so feel free to adapt the whole environment or parts of it to your liking.

## Ideology

I needed a setup that could handle multiple programming environments whilst being as lightweight and minimal as possible and so this is what i came up with.

## Applications, dependencies, ETC.
For **WindowManager** , i use [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3), as for **code editors and IDEs**, i use [NVim (primary)](https://github.com/neovim/neovim), [Emacs (secondary),](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs) [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) (rarely). 
here's a list of everything you *probably* need to run this setup, as a yay command :
```sh
yay -S polybar neovim i3-gaps dunst ncmpcpp rofi fish kitty mpd emacs flameshot feh  
```
## Installation

I will make a install script soon, but for now, you could figure it out yourself.

## Credits

This setup is practically ravaged, i shamelessly stole some of the stuff from others and i also made some stuff myself, i will try to credit the owners.
