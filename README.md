## Stuff used

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - For managing terminals and splitting them for more efficiency
- [OLD] - [AwesomeWM](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) - awesome window manager
- [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) - Vim but better.
- [Startpage](https://github.com/Tobias-Schoch/startpage-wave) - Made by a fellow reddit user, its a super cool startpage for chrome 
- [OLD] - [Telegram Desktop](https://t.me/addtheme/qA9wezvgHXCfzpEi) - The telegram desktop theme is usable at this link
- [OLD] - [Telegram Mobile](https://t.me/addtheme/blueglazephone) - The same theme, ported on mobile using [This tool](https://github.com/MrYadro/TDeskDroid)


## Installation
You need to change a couple of lines to your preference:
> bspwm/bspwmrc:19 path to wallpaper
> shxkd/shxkdrc:7 path to alacritty config and executable
> shxkd/shxkdrc:9 path to alacritty config and executable
> tmux/.tmux.local.conf:379 if you want tmux status bar enabled 

Hopefully thats it.
